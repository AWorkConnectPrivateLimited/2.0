AutoLit Ai is an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser—no local setup required. If you're here to build your own AI-powered web dev agent using the Bolt open source codebase,

This AutoLit Ai allows you to choose the LLM that you use for each prompt! Currently, you can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, LMStudio, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, or Groq models - and it is easily extended to use any other model supported by the Vercel AI SDK! See the instructions below for running this locally and extending it to include more models.


What Makes AutoLit Ai Different
Claude, v0, etc are incredible- but you can't install packages, run backends, or edit code. That’s where AutoLit Ai stands out:

Full-Stack in the Browser: AutoLit Ai integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment  WebContainers. This allows you to:

Install and run npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)
Run Node.js servers
Interact with third-party APIs
Deploy to production from chat
Share your work via a URL
AI with Environment Control: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, AutoLit Ai gives AI models complete control over the entire environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the whole app lifecycle—from creation to deployment.

Whether you’re an experienced developer, a PM, or a designer, AutoLit Ai allows you to easily build production-grade full-stack applications.
